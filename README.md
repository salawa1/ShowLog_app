## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Welcome to **ShowLog's** back-end. This is the server-side component of the ShowLog application. It contains all the API endpoints and database management tools necessary to manage TV show data, reviews, and watchlists. The backend communicates with a PostgreSQL database and uses Postman to test API endpoints.

CREATE TABLE shows (

    name TEXT NULL,
    seasons TEXT NULL,
    genre TEXT NULL,
    releaseyear TEXT NULL,
    country TEXT NULL,
